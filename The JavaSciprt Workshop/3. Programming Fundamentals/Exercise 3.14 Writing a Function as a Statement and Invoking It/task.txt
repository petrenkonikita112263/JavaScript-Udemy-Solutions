This exercise will define a function as a statement and then use it. The function we will
create will accept one parameter and return an array. If the parameter can be validated
as a number, then each item in the array has one digit from the number starting with
the 0 index item holding the digit for the ones place value, the 1 index item holding the
digit for the tens place value, and so on.

We will use the log method of the console object in this exercise. Remember that a
method is a function that belongs to an object, so it can have parameters. The log
method takes an unlimited number of parameters.
