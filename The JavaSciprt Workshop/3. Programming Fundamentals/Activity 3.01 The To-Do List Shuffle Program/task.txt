This activity will help you build a todo list web page. We will use JavaScript 
to load the list and shuffle the list after it has been loaded. 
A button labeled Shuffle has been added to the HTML file and 
the ol element has been assigned the ID, todo-list.

The high-level steps for the activity are as follows:
1. Use the activity.js file to write your code. This contains coding hint comments
you may use if you desire. It also includes a function named getNewShuffledArray.

2. You need to load the li element todo items from JavaScript and then allow the user
to randomize the list. You may approach the activity in two parts.

In Part 1, you need to use an array for the todo list items and create a function that
updates the HTML DOM list items using an ol element and an array as parameters.
The function will remove the previous li elements and iterate through the array
to add new li elements with the values in the array parameter. Test before
proceeding. You can find the HTML file at https://packt.live/2XcP1GU

In Part 2, add a function to respond to the Shuffle button's click event. The
function will use the original array of todo items and your previous function to
update the ol element's list items. It also will use the getNewShuffledArray function
to randomly shuffle an array and return the shuffled array.
