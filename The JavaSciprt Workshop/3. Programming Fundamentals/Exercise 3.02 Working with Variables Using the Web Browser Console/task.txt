Declare a variable named firstName:
> var firstName
\\Value is expressed as undefined
< undefined

Write the data type of the variable:
>typeof firstName
\\Output
< "undefined"

Assign the string value Albert to the firstName variable:
>firstName = "Albert"
\\Output
< "Albert"

To find out what data type our input is, use the typeof keyword, as shown here:
>typeof firstName
\\Output
< "string"

To find out what value our firstName variable is holding, we simply need to write
the following code:
>firstName
\\Output
< "Albert"

Declare a variable and assign it to a number expression:
> var totalLikes = 50
\\Output. Console may express value when declared but before assigned
< undefined

Write the value of totalLikes:
>totalLikes
\\Output
< 50

To ascertain the data type, we will once again use typeof, as shown here:
>typeof totalLikes
< "number

Here is the code for changing the value held by totalLikes:
>totalLikes = totalLikes + 1
\\Output. New value is expressed
< 51

Compare the value of totalLikes using the following code:
>totalLikes> 100
< false

Declare a variable and assign it to a Boolean expression:
> var isSold = false
\\Output. Console may express undefined data type when declared but before assigned.
< undefined

Write the data type, like so:
>typeof isSold
< "boolean"
