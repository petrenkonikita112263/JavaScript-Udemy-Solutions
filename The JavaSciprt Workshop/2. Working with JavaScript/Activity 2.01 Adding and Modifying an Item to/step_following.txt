It is structured with a <head> tag and a <body> tag, and nested within the <body> tag exists the visual elements and the data a user would be able to see within their web browser. Additionally, within this file, you will see a set of CSS style rules within the <style> tags, which provide visual HTML elements with some additional specific colors, fonts, and sizes. The CSS refers to additional stylistic font information being loaded from remote Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/) services.
