/*
Let's utilize all the information we have learned about in this chapter and see what we
have retained. For this activity, imagine that you are working with a team of developers
and your project is to create a stateful model that stores entries for a To-Do application.
The model will be a primary function, though other functions can be created and used
by it. The function will need to store one or more entries and will receive "actions" that
tell the state to change.
These actions will include the following:
• Create a new To-Do
• Remove a To-Do
• Modify a To-Do
Actions will be passed to the state with a given action keyword of either CREATE, REMOVE,
or MODIFY.
