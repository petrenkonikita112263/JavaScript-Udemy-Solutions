Our library won't be capable of much at first, but you may want to put some effort into
it and extend it as you wish.
HeadlineCreator.js is our library's name. It's a good name because it already hints at
what it does; that is, it creates headlines. Technically speaking, our library will do the
following:
• Be accessible on the global window object of the current browser tab, just as we've
seen with jQuery before: window.headlineCreator.
• Provide a single method called createHeadline.
• Allow us (through the createHeadline method) to create a headline with the given
text and append it to a given parent element.
• Take care of error handling for us, for instance, if we forgot to define some text to
be displayed or passed an invalid selector for the parent element
• To verify that our library is working and having an example of its usage, we will
create, additional to creating the library itself, an HTML page including script tags
using our HeadlineCreator.js library.
